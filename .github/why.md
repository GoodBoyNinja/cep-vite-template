## Why do I need a template?
If you are new to CEP extensions and only have extendscript knowledge, you will quickly find out that CEP is not so plug and play. Unlike scripts, there is a lot of setup involved. You might think to yourself 'I ain't afraid of no setup' and that's fine, but if you're gonna go that route beware that it will take a lot of time and effort to get your extension up and running.

Using a template does not mean you don't have to learn how CEP works. It just saves you from hours of googling and trial and error. You will still have to familiarize yourself with CEP, Vite, node.js, npm and all of those tools. It's better that you focus on learning and creating your extension rather than setting up your environment.

> Users don't think you're cool because you set up your environment from scratch. They think you're cool because you made a cool extension.
