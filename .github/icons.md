## Adding App Icons
You can have icons show up in the ZXP installer, which makes the user's first touch with your app a little nicer.
Go to `CSXS/manifest.xml` and uncomment the `<Icon>` tags at the bottom of the file. Follow the format of the now uncommented code to add your own icons under `CSXS/icons/`.
